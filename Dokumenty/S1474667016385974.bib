abstract = {The paper discusses the artificial hand movement control problem, treated as recognition of electromyography signals; it describes the measuring standard and the implementation aspects connected to EMG signals measurements. The methods used for reduction and classification of the EMG signals are presented together with the discussion of the factors affecting of movement decision recognition of human hand.}
